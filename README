Win/ contains the Windows UI (in C++)
OSX/ contains the OSX UI (in ObjC)
./ contains the GTK UI. (in C)

COMPILING:
---------

Windows - (You can compile this with Visual Studio Express 2010)
	Open Minutorwin.sln in Visual C++, switch the target to Release, compile the solution to
		generate Minutor.exe
	Run make_installer.bat to make the minutor.msi installer.
		(This part requires you to install WiX)

OSX -
	Open minutor.xcodeproj in XCode. Compile the solution to
		generate minutor.app
	Run DiskUtility to create a dmg.  Put app in dmg.  :)

Linux -
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	or you can go crazy and use debuild to make a .deb file
	$ debuild -us  ; makes a deb for your platform (unsigned)
	$ debuild -ai386 -us ; makes an x86 .deb (unsigned)
