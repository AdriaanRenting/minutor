All 3 platform source files are here.
MinutorMap/ contains the map generating code used by all 3 versions. (in C)
Minutor/ contains the Windows UI (in C#)
OSX/ contains the OSX UI (in ObjC)
./ contains the GTK UI. (in C)

COMPILING:
---------

Windows - (Everything can be done with the Express versions of VS..)
	Open MinutorMap.sln in Visual C++, compile the solution to
		generate MinutorMap.dll
	Then open Minutor.sln in Visual C#, compile the solution
		to generate Minutor.exe.
	Run make_installer.bat to make the minutor.msi installer.
		(This part requires you to install WiX)

	The separate dll is because the map generating code is written
	in unmanaged C to be portable.. the gui is written in C# due to
	simplicity.

OSX -
	Open minutor.xcodeproj in XCode. Compile the solution to
		generate minutor.app
	Run DiskUtility to create a dmg.  Put app in dmg.  :)

Linux -
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

	or you can go crazy and use debuild to make a .deb file
