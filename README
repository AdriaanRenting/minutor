This is the source code for Minutor 2.0 (beta)
web/ contains the source code for the web-based pack builder.  The live version
can be found at http://seancode.com/minutor/packs

The Makefile inside web/ will use the Closure Compiler to compile all the .js files
into a single editor.min.js.  To host the pack builder on your own website, you
only need editor.min.js, index.html, main.css, and the mods/ folder.

COMPILING:
---------

All Platforms:
Use QtCreator (Qt5 version) and open minutor.pro. Change kit to Release.  Build.

Linux:
If you'd rather use the command line, run qmake to generate a Makefile from
minutor.pro, then run make
