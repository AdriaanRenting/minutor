This is the source code for Minutor 2.0 (beta)
web/ contains the source code for the web-based pack builder.  The live version
can be found at http://seancode.com/minutor/packs

The Makefile inside web/ will use the Closure Compiler to compile all the .js files
into a single editor.min.js.  To host the pack builder on your own website, you
only need editor.min.js, index.html, main.css, and the mods/ folder.

COMPILING:
---------

All Platforms:
Use QtCreator (Qt5 version) and open minutor.pro. Change kit to Release.  Build.

Linux:
If you'd rather use the command line, run qmake to generate a Makefile from
minutor.pro, then run make

To make a package:

    $ debuild

To make a package for another distribution:
    $ pbuilder-dist raring create   # called only once to generate environment
    $ debuild -S -us
    $ pbuilder-dist raring build *.dsc



MacOS:
Make a static compile of Qt by downloading the source code and then

	cd qtbase
    ./configure -prefix $PWD -opensource -confirm-license -nomake tests -nomake examples -release -static 
	make

Then compile Minutor by:

	~/path/to/qtbase/bin/qmake
	make
